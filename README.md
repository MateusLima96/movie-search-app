## Search Movie App

In this app you are able to look up for any movie and add it to a favourite list.
I could explore some key features from React, Typescript, Bootstrap and CSS. I have integrated the app with <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDB api</a>. The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, including all content and images.
The app is responsive.
